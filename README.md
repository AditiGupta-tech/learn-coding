Hi, I am Aditi and I share code snippets from what I learn and implement. 

I have faced challenges while understanding some functionalities even after going through various sources.

So, this is an attempt to simplify this learning experience for all the new and budding coders. 

Feel free to use them and learn. 

If you find this repo insightful, do share with me on my social handles/email (you can access them from my github bio).

Keep coding and keep growing!

~Note: Unless explicitly mentioned, webdev codes will not cater to the UI part. They are shared to show you how things work. Feel free to enhance UI.
      If you do, do share them with me/tag me. I would love to see your enhancements.
